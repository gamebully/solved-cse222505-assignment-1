This homework is designed for you

<ul>

 <li>to review OOP concepts and Java programming,</li>

 <li>to get used to reporting conventions that will be used in the course.</li>

</ul>

In this homework you are not allowed to use any data structure other that simple arrays. Later, we may reuse the same scenario and ask you to implement the same system using some data structures introduced during this course.

<strong>SCENARIO:</strong>

Design and implement an automation system for a company that sells office furnitures.

An example requirement set is defined as follows: The company has 4 different branches and sells both in-store and online. The store sells office chairs (7 models and for each, 5 colors), office desks (5 models and for each, 4 colors), meeting tables (10 models and for each, 4 colors), bookcases (12 models) and office cabinets (12 models). The automation system has users such as administrators, branch employees and customers. Administrators manage the system by adding and removing branches and branch employees. They can also query whether there are any products that need to be supplied. A special customer number is defined for each customer in the system. When a person subscribes to the system, he/she uses his/her name, surname and e-mail address, and defines a password. When the registration is completed, the customer number is automatically defined in the system and the user is informed about it. When the customer logs into the system, they can search for products, see the list of products, see which store a product is in, shop online by entering address and phone information, and view their previous orders. Branch employees can inquire about the products in stock, inform the manager that the product should be purchased when any product is less than the requested amount, add / remove products, make sales, access the information of the previous orders of a customer by using the customer number and add new order to this section. Branch employees should update the customers’ previous orders section during their sales from the store. If the customer is shopping for the first time, then they should create a new subscription.

You should define your own set of requirements and design and implement a system for them. Note that your system should include the features in “grading” section. Do not overextend the requirements that makes the implementation harder. Similarly, do not oversimplify the requirements; the software system should be a complete automation system and your implementation should include all required features.

<strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>

<ul>

 <li>Use only Array</li>

 <li>Can be only one main class in project</li>

 <li>Don’t use any other third part library</li>
